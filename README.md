Multilingual Dependency Parsing, the first assignment for NLP class on coursera.

There are three scripts you can use, `parse.py`, `train_models.py` and `verify.py`
`parse.py` is used for parsing sentences into Dependency Graph.
It can be used as follows:
`cat inputfile | python parse.py language.model > output.conll`
you have to create inputfile that contains languages you want to parse.

And the language.model file will be generated by running the `train_models.py` script.
you can run the scripts as follow:
`python train_models.py [lang1 lang2 lang3]`
if you didn't type any language, it will train all of the languages.

You can also verify the models we have tuned by using the scripts:
`python verify.py [lang1 lang2 lang3]`
if you didn't type any language, it will verify all of the languages.
